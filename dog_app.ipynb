    "Getting the 4D tensor ready for ResNet-50, and for any other pre-trained model in Keras, requires some additional processing.  First, the RGB image is converted to BGR by reordering the channels.  All pre-trained models have the additional normalization step that the mean pixel (expressed in RGB as $[103.939, 116.779, 123.68]$ and calculated from all pixels in all images in ImageNet) must be subtracted from every pixel in each image.  This is implemented in the imported function `preprocess_input`.

This is implemented in the `ResNet50_predict_labels` function below.\n",

You must create your CNN _from scratch_ (so, you can't use transfer learning _yet_!), and you must attain a test accuracy of at least 1%.  In Step 5 of this notebook, you will have the opportunity to use transfer learning to create a CNN that attains greatly improved accuracy.\n",
